bae-triangle-heart.js (code file for generation data)

In this programming assignment, I used the demos in class for reference for many of the functions. In the generation of the triangles, I used
a scale of 0.25, as the generation appeared pleasant in such a ratio and did not overlap. One part I must explain is a prototype function that
I named "newColor" to iterate through a new list in the 3 x 3 hearts generated. Thus, after one generation before an offset, the color array 
would be moved. I did this such that to save lines of code in place of making a linked list and pushing the head to the tail. 

Otherwise, the GL position in the HTML, as well as the FragColor, were borrowed from concepts learned during class and the appropriate demos. 
For the color of the triangles, I tried to approximate with software that detected color from images - notably from my screenshot of the 
assignment. Thank you for your time, and for what you have taught us thus far!
