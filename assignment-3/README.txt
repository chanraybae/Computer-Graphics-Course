clock.js - file that stores all the matrices and translations/rotations appropriate for displaying the clock
clock.html - HTML for displaying the final output

I am taking the week extension for one assignment offered by Professor Wang on this assignment.

I got all the working details of the clock down, including the markers, but of the 15 points for the 
circles and their ratios, as well as layering, along with the heart. My heart was not able to display
correctly besides being a purple one, which I assume is 5 points (or less since the heart displayed) off 
out of the components necessary for the first task. Everything else I was able to do accomplish and runs
correctly.

Thank you so much for your time!
