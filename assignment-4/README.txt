Done with 48 hour Sara Bea Disability Accommodation, thank you so much for your assistance!


The orrery HTML file was slightly altered so that the buttons would show up below the diagram, as I felt
that the horizontal integration would make it unhandy for users to operate on such a wide lateral scale.
Since the grading did not require such parameter to put them to the side like the demo look, I decided
it was better to place them below. Other variables created are explained by their naming structure, such as the
earthRef variable for the moon. 

All other tasks have been met, and all buttons are functional - for the projection() to prevent distortion in task 9, I 
labeled the code with // task 9 for an easier finding of that grading criteria. 

Thank you so much for your time in grading this!
